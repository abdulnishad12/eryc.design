# E. Design

My personal website where I showcase my work and services.

## Timeline

- [**August, 18th** — Launched the Version 2 of the website](#e-design--version-2)
- [Recap of my first year as a freelancer](#2018-recap)
- [Launched the First Version of the website](e-design--version-1)

### E. Design — Version 2
Now, in August, 2019, it was time to introduce a fresher, more sophisticated and more serious look.

In the near future, I plan on bringing Case Studies, new projects and full service pages to describe a little better what I offer.

It took me about 5 hours to complete this project in [Webflow](https://webflow.com). 
As usual, I like to maintain the code in Git and then ship it to Netlify.

### 2018 Recap
After 1 year freelancing, and right before New Years Eve, I wanted to share my accomplishments, my learnings and my gratitude. That's when I decided to design a Recap of my first year as a freelancer.

It was tough getting the design ready, but with [Webflow](https://webflow.com), it took me about 8 hours to get this website ready to launch. *From scratch.*

### E. Design — Version 1
I designed this website as my first actual portfolio. 
It was meant to be a link that I could send to clients, and it would express a little bit about me and my personality. 

I used bold typefaces from Adobe Fonts and lots of hover effects.

It was also my first Website launched using [Webflow](https://webflow.com)
